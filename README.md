#  Fetching Posts
    ## In this section, we followed the following steps:
    
        1 - We created a file in the utils folder for storing constants and URLs that
        will be required when we will fetch the data.
        
        2 - Then we implemented the custom fetch function for fetching data
        from the APIs. It has 2 parameters body and customConfig.
        
        3 - Here we used the try and catch method so that the app doesn’t crash
        when an error is encountered.
        
        4 - We have used async-await syntax here with fetch.
        
        5 - An async function starts a request and returns a promise. When
        the request completes, the promise is resolved with the
        Response object. If the request fails, the promise is rejected.
        
        6 - The await keyword causes the JavaScript runtime to pause your
        code on this line, not allowing further code to execute in the
        meantime until the async function call has returned its result —
        very useful if subsequent code relies on that result! Therefore,
        the await keyword is used before the fetch function.
        
        7 - Since the body is an object and an object can’t be passed in fetch
        function. So, if it is present it is first converted into a string and then
        passed through the fetch function.
        
        8 - The response received from the firebase. 
        
        9 - For styling, we used CSS modules in which class names are scoped
        locally for avoiding naming conflicts.
        
# Firebase Authorization:  
    ## Authorization: 
    This is the most important scenario where firebase/auth is
    used. It helps to persist the user and once the user is logged in, the onAuthStateChanged
    request will include all the resources, accesses that are permitted to
    the user.
